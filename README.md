# S12_CGILS_LES_forcing
Forcing files (netcdf) and parameter namelist files for LES simulations of varying wind shear and background aerosol concentration. S12_CGILS_control.nc is the same forcing file used in the Polluted case as the large-scale winds remain the same. Prm files contain the namelist parameters and other model configuration choices available in SAM.
